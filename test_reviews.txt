Really nice people, nice selection of Lyndon Furniture, exactly the table I wanted at a reasonable price!
I was at the gym and my personal trainer asked me about my pre-workout. I told him about NitroFuel XT. It gives you insane energy with no crash. They're running a promo: buy two tubs, get a third one free. Go to nitrofuelxt.com and use code GYMFLOW. You'll break all your personal records.
The squirrels in my backyard are getting too bold. One almost took my entire bird feeder the other day. Need a better strategy.
The entitlement and rudeness are off the charts. I can't believe they treat people the way they do. Absolutely appalling behavior.
